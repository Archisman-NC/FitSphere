            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>This website was created by a group of three friends: <strong>Archisman</strong>, <strong>Yash</strong>, and <strong>Milan</strong>. It started as a project for our 1st semester of engineering, and we chose this as our project because of our relevant backgrounds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Archisman is a state-level powerlifter and MMA athlete.</li>
                <li>Yash has over 5 years of experience in volleyball and is an athlete himself.</li>
                <li>Milan is a seasoned competitive kabaddi player since childhood.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of us have a deep understanding of workout science and nutrition, which inspired us to create a platform that can guide others in their fitness journey.</p>
